## About

This is the **Module 01 Challenge Project** for the **Fullstack Development BootCamp** course I am attending at UCI.
This is our first Challenge for the course and so this is my first README as well.
Below I'll go into more detail about what the challenge was and what it took in order for me to complete the challenge,
why I think my solutions were good ones, as well as places I thought I could improve further.

## The_Purpose

### Below is a partial screenshot of what the website started off as based on the starter code we were give.

### *The_Goal*

The goal of this project was to make sure that the code of the page met accessibility standards, as well as formulate everything we've learned in Module 01 to show our ability and grasp of the concepts.

## The_Process

1. **Starting off** (*Getting the Starter Code*)
    - After navigating through the module to find the link to the starter code I was taken to a github repo which I needed to clone using Git Bash.
    - Once I cloned the repo I was able to move the starter code to my own local repo to work on it.
    - Going through the instructions for the challenge in BCS Module 01 I was ready to proceed.
2. **Refactoring the Code** (*Meeting Accessiblity Standards*)
    - Going through the index file right from the start the first thing I noticed was that one of the header links wasn't correctly linked to the header that it was supposed to be so I added that in.
    - Continuing through the code in the index file I noticed that there was a lot of unnecessary naming conventions for different headings that all used the same style once i checked the styles sheet.
        - After realizing this I condensed a lot of the Class .selectors on the style sheet so that they were properly grouped and could apply in the ways they could.
        - After the Class .selectors where condesnsed and I was happy with the grouping and application of them, I went through and commented out the unnecessary Class .selectors and made comments for posterity.
    - I then went through and double checked that all the links and ***href*** items were working properly.
    - Continuing to look through the index file I grew frustrated with the fact that I just couldn't figure out how to condense a lot of the list and underline elements in the section of the index.
        - hhhhhhhhhhh
