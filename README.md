## About

This is the **Module 01 Challenge Project** for the **Fullstack Development BootCamp** course I am attending at UCI.
This is our first Challenge for the course and so this is my first README as well.
Below I'll go into more detail about what the challenge was and what it took in order for me to complete the challenge,
why I think my solutions were good ones, as well as places I thought I could improve further.

## Goals
